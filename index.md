# John Lucas’s Portfolio

I am a computer science student at CSUF, and I expect to graduate in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 6, Part 2

Part 2 Lab 6 was computing the score for a hand of blackjack. I loved this part because I do play blackjack when I go out to casinos or on an app. I loved learning how to integrate Booleans and different functions to complete the assignment.

*  Lab 3, Part 1

Lab 3 Part 1 was calculating a person’s BMR. I loved this part because it was both challenging and fun to create. This program for me is something I like to create in the future for health.

* Lab 9, Part 2

Lab 9 Part 2 was creating a few variations about guessing a secret number. I enjoyed completing this lab because I like coding different types of games. Although I did run into difficulty in completing this part, I found joy in how this game works and its function.
